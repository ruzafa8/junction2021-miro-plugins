# Junction 2021 - Miro plugins

Our Miro apps for their Junction 2021 challenge: Collaborate Without Constraint.

To build any of the apps, `cd` into its directory and follow the steps in the [Miro Web SDK's Hello World](https://miro-ea.readme.io/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app).

Each app requires an API key too, as explained in their `README.md` files.
